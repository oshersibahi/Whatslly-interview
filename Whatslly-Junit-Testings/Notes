Hey Osher,

How are you?

Thanks for submitting the task, it looks good!
I do have some feedback:
1. In your test, you disregarded the JSON response returned from the endpoint. 
	This is an important part of the test as we don't only want to check that the server is alive - we want to validate that the properties returned are valid.
2. You didn't include a properties file in the test package, so any properties that you put in the main package won't apply to your tests.
3. As mentioned on our call - every piece of code should always be developed in a re-usable way,
	 so we won't need to re-write it when we had a similar method and we can simply leverage code that has already been written.
	 In the tests you built, the endpoint is static (host + path) so we cannot reuse it.
4. Why did you decide to put all your code in one file and not breaking it into multiple? For example, from my experience enums need to be on a standalone file for re-usability.
5. I am missing some comments and explanations about what was done here. Other developers won't understand it otherwise.

Yanir.
